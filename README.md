# Workshop for Free energy Calculations for Chemical and Biological Systems


    The department of Chemsitry & High Performance Computing group of IIT Kanpur are jointly 
    organized a workshop on free energy calculations for chemical and biological systems.
    
    
    This workshop is focussed on the methods for free energy calculations using molecular dynamics methods.
    The lectures and hands-on sessions by the experts are directed to train Ph.D. students and postdoctoral 
    fellows in free energy calculations.  Theoretical background of various methods will be covered in the 
    lectures. Hands-on sessions will be given using PLUMED and PIMD programs which are interfaced to large 
    number of molecular simulation programs like GROMACS, AMBER, CP2K, Gaussian, VASP etc.
